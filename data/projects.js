        description: `In my view, engineering is about building solutions that address real-world problems. To drive innovation, we must first understand and utilize existing technologies effectively, which ultimately paves the way for future advancements. <br/>
        This project showcases network programming (socket programming) in C++, where I developed a custom Bro Server that functions similarly to Tomcat or XAMPP. The server provides web developers with a familiar and useful tool to streamline their work. <br />
        Through this project, I gained deep insights into network communication, client-server interactions, and the fundamentals of how web servers operate. Moreover, I learned to troubleshoot and optimize network-based applications, which strengthened my problem-solving skills in system-level programming.

        • Student Management System - It is a fun project to understand, In general how management system works.<br/><br/>

        • Replica Of STL - It is also a fun project to understand the importance of virtual polymorphism and how it is implemented in predefined library/classes.<br/><br/>
        • tmcommon - It is just string utility project.<br/><br/>
        • TMDate - It is a kind of replica of Date class which present in Java, hence Traditional C++ won't provide anything related to Date.<br/><br/>
        • SQlite3 - RDMBS for c++ projects.<br/><br/>
