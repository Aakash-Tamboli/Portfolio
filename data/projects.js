        description: `In my view, engineering is about building solutions that address real-world problems. To drive innovation, we must first understand and utilize existing technologies effectively, which ultimately paves the way for future advancements.
        This project showcases network programming (socket programming) in C++, where I developed a custom Bro Server that functions similarly to Tomcat or XAMPP. The server provides web developers with a familiar and useful tool to streamline their work.
        Through this project, I gained deep insights into network communication, client-server interactions, and the fundamentals of how web servers operate. Moreover, I learned to troubleshoot and optimize network-based applications, which strengthened my problem-solving skills in system-level programming.

        1) Student Management System - It is a fun project to understand, In general how management system works.\n

        2) Inventory - It is a General Quantity Based Measurement console based software which teach me how to develop a software in layered programing approach.\n

        3) Replica Of STL - It is also a fun project to understand the importance of virtual polymorphism and how it is implemented in predefined library/classes.\n

        4) tmcommon - It is just string utility project.\n

        5) TMDate - It is a kind of replica of Date class which present in Java, hence Traditional C++ won't provide anything related to Date.\n

        6) SQlite3 - RDMBS for c++ projects.\n
